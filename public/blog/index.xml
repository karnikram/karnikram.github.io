      <description>Motivation In robot vision we frequently deal with problems where the motion of an object is to be estimated. For instance, if a drone is being moved around in a scene and we were to reconstruct a 3D model of the scene using the images from the drone, we need a way to model and represent the trajectory of the camera to know where the images were taken from. The motion of the drone is typically modeled as a rigid body motion (a rotation and a translation, more formally called a Special Euclidean Transformation \(SE(3)\)), a topic which has been studied extensively.</description>
