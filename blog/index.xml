      <description>Motivation In robotic vision, we frequently deal with problems where the motion of a camera is to be estimated. For instance, if a drone is being moved around in a scene and we were to reconstruct a 3D model of the scene using the images from the drone&amp;rsquo;s camera, we need a way to model and represent the trajectory of the camera and know where the images were taken from, before we can recover the geometry of the scene.</description>
