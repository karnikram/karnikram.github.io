    <section id="post-body">
        <p>2020 was generally an unproductive year for me. Like a lot of people I spent far too much time doom-scrolling through Twitter and Youtube, and constantly checking the news. While most of the content I consumed was just mindless noise that I could&rsquo;ve done well without, I did fall into a few rabbit holes here and there that eventually did improve my quality of life. And probably the biggest one out of them was discovering the (rather niche) category of non-linear note-taking apps.</p>
<p>In regular hierarchial note-taking apps like Notion or Evernote your notes are organised in a tree-like structure. For example, they are organised starting from the top-most area, to the subject, to the topic, and then finally to the note. While this form of linear note-taking works well for some type of notes, it can be very rigid for areas like research where the boundaries aren&rsquo;t well defined (and for good reason). Such a setup can also introduce a lot of friction as you need to carefully decide about which &lsquo;note book&rsquo; a particular note needs to go into. Non-linear note-taking apps turn this structure on its head by giving you a blank slate to start with. You take &lsquo;daily notes&rsquo; and as your notes accumulate, you reference your old notes and form links between them which results in a &lsquo;knowledge graph&rsquo;. This actively encourages interest topics to be formed bottom-up and connections to be formed between different areas. There has been an explosion of such apps in the last couple of years, which I think can be traced back to this great <a href="https://vimeo.com/275530205">talk</a> by education researcher Sönke Ahrens in a developer conference where he first advocated for the need of such apps (and his <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34507927-how-to-take-smart-notes">book</a>). I invested some time playing around with Roam Research, Obsidian, and Dynalist before finally converging to <a href="https://remnote.io">Remnote</a>.</p>
<p>The great thing about Remnote is its tight integration with active recall and spaced repetition. Active recall and spaced repetition, as you probably already know intuitively if not the names, is the practice of actively testing on yourself on topics and trying to retrieve them from memory in increasingly-spaced intervals of time. This is a far more effective strategy to understand and learn new topics, and also retain them, than passively re-reading them. Remnote implements this by automatically converting your notes into flashcards that goes into a daily practice queue. Based on how well you answer a card, the app decides when to show you the card the next time. This is similar to the Anki app, but unlike in Anki your cards are not disparate objects but instead belong to your notes which in turn belong to your knowledge graph.</p>
<p>While flascards are generally used to remember raw facts or cram for exams, I think they have a much bigger scope. If used properly, they can help with retaining fundamental concepts and forming a strong base, understanding new topics deeply, and re-discovering old ideas and sparking new connections. I currently use Remnote to mostly make notes and flascards about the research papers or textbooks I&rsquo;m reading, and some code API which I might need to revisit again. I also sometimes use it to make flaschards about quotes and ideas from any non-fiction book that I&rsquo;m reading, or even some interesting works of fiction that I want to be reminded about again. I generally go through my practice queue on Remnote once or twice during the in-between moments of any day such as when I&rsquo;m eating or walking. I also use it on those once-in-a-blue-moon days when I go running.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile I highly recommend reading this excellent <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">article</a> by Michael Nielsen on using Anki for research.</p>
